# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classification

# Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia which leads to memory loss and decline in
thinking. AD is a progressive disease and usually starts slowly, but changes in the brain can begin many
years before the appearance of first symptoms.
In this study, we aim to use demographic and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data for both demented
and nondemented adults to build classifiers that predict whether a subject will be diagnosed to develop
dementia. Two datasets are used: one deals with cross-sectional MRI data for adults aged between 18 to 96,
and the other deals with longitudinal MRI data for older adults between 60 to 96.
Our datasets can be found in Kaggle. The data was originally collected and released by the Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center at Washington University and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS).


# Our goal
